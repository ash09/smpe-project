running tests on facebook data 

Objectives:

1- 95% confidence interval for the post views case of paid post, which will give us the number of views we have to expect in case of advertised post.

2-same as 1 but for non paid posts so we can compare paid and not paid post , and drive out how much facebook advertisement is effective.

3- correlation of post views and number of interaction . to show that the number of views should be directly correlated to the interaction.

4- type of the post and number of interaction and post views in boxplot graphs (fairly easy but the analysis of such data is lovely ), i will try to find a reference that have talked about this thing and compare both results.

5- time of the post and views correlation and boxplot of the interaction according to time, i will prefer to take a time slot of 2 hour over 12:00 pm to 12:00 pm to excludes the out-layers, i guess we should end up with a peak at 8:00 - 10:00 pm.
